# factorio-mod-constructor-equipment
A mod for the game Factorio, adding equipment for short range automated construction.

This mod is not finished.

The actual construction effect should work as intended.

Variables such as construction frequency, energy cost, etc are subject to change.

There are no in-world animations. The built entities simply appear.

The item/research/etc icons are ugly copies of base graphics.

Running speed modification will be incompatible with other speed mods like ProgressiveRunning.e
