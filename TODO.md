# Outstanding, from the walk round of 2026-09-19

## 9. An arm stops when its owner stands on what it was reaching for

It should give up on that one and go to something else rather than waiting.

Not reproduced. A walk of the whole showroom built everything that should have been built
and left standing only what each bay exists to leave standing, and a character who steps
onto a ghost mid reach gives up on it within a few ticks and builds the next one along. The
paths that could have waited are all covered: choose() passes over what its owner stands in
and sorts a pickup underfoot to the back of the queue, advance() asks again every tick and
turns to something else, and a spot a vehicle has rolled onto fails buildable() and is never
offered. So this wants the bay, the save or the tier it was seen on before there is anything
to fix.

## 12. An arm should aim where its target will be, not where it is

While the player or the vehicle is moving, assume the current heading and speed hold, and
reach for the position the target will have reached by the time the arm can reach it.
